# update_addons


- Updates and manages local WoW (World of Warcraft) addon folders/files if the addon author hosts them on GitHub.
- *Currently only works for base ElvUI (https://github.com/tukui-org/ElvUI/tree/main), but further support to come.*


# Why would I need this?


- If you're a WoW player tired of having to manually update addons that CurseForge doesn't support (ElvUI, etc.).


# How does it work?


- It updates addons locally using the latest version hosted on GitHub by their respective addon authors.
- If out of date versions of those addons exist locally, they are renamed as a backup measure before the latest version is installed.
- If your local version of the addons are up to date, it stops and tells you.

- This is done through a python script run locally on your computer. 
- For general ease of use, I may implement it through an Electron-based desktop app in the future.
